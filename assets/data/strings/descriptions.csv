torgue_basic_monitor,SHIP,"This ship has been refitted by the Torgue smiths and features heavier armor plating, increased overall performance and unique systems.

An oddity among ships, the Monitor is the result of the line of thought that “sometimes the best defense is indeed the best defense”. Features turret mounts angled to provide wide arcs and a unique “flux shunt” modification to its power systems specially constructed to relieve flux generated by shields. Indeed, the Monitor makes up for a lack of maneuverability and firepower with the ability to withstand prolonged bombardment from enemy ordnance.

Though its experimental nature is perhaps a sign of the innovation that eras of turmoil seem to inspire, whether the Monitor’s radical defensive focus is a boon or pitfall remains contentious. Several dramatic failures in convoy protection patrols were explained by Ko Combine PR representatives to be the fault of improper tactics employed by convoy commanders. Ko Combine maintains that when positioned correctly in a combat situation and supported by strike-craft - as the anvil and hammer, respectively - simulations demonstrate that the Monitor significantly enhances convoy survivability against the average pirate attack. Prominent critics remain.",,,

torgue_basic_cerberus,SHIP,"This ship has been refitted by the Torgue smiths and features heavier armor plating, increased overall performance and unique systems.

The Cerberus is prized for providing a cost-effective balance between cargo capacity and enough combat power for its size to discourage casual piracy with the happy result of lowered insurance rates compared to standard Domain-era civilian grade freighters. The Cerberus is now widely considered to be a wise platform of operation for independent traders in the Sector. 

In times past, before the fall of the gate system when Domain authority reigned, combat-enabled freighters like the Cerberus found only niche use on the edges of the rare warzone or in especially uncivilized hinterlands of the galaxy where Domain Armada patrols were stretched thinly. The crew combat training, weapon maintenance, and mass/thrust ratio loss caused by heavier armour were viewed as causing unnecessary cost overhead. But this is a new age filled with both danger and profitable opportunities; the abilities of the Cerberus have given the hull a new life in the trade lanes.",,,

torgue_basic_enforcer,SHIP,"This ship has been refitted by the Torgue smiths and features heavier armor plating, increased overall performance and unique systems.

The Enforcer-class ships commonly serve in system or convoy defense roles. The design features good armor and multiple ballistic hardpoints, while shield performance is somewhat underwhelming. 

The blueprints of the ship call for many components similar to those found in the Onslaught-class battleships, suggesting that the designs were created during a similar period of military expansion in the Domain. The Enforcer-class features similar no-nonsense weapon system design choices, tough bulkheads, and is well regarded by its crews.

Tough to beat in a destroyer to destroyer fight, the Enforcer rarely takes part in larger battles due to the common view that its low speed makes it a liability. Nonetheless, Hegemony order of battle doctrines mandate an attached Enforcer squadron as a screen for Onslaught-class battleships. The logistical ease with which shared components can be used by both ship types is exactly the type of detail that excites Hegemony Logisticarum bureaucrats.",,,

The Medusa is one of the most respected destroyers in the sector due to its association with black ops and elite pirates. The few that have been aboard a Medusa can attest to its extreme level of technological sophistication. Medusa-class blueprints are few in number and are some of the rarest and most closely guarded data in the Sector.

Deemed too expensive to mass produce by most corporations and governments, it is rarely employed by the lawful authorities as a black ops cruiser. On the rarest occasion, a Medusa-class hull may fall into the hands of pirates. The usual results are a drastic reduction in system small to medium shipping, which puts a strain on most planetary and outpost economies.

Ponderous and menacing, the Dominator-class is one of the most widespread system defense cruisers in Hegemony space. 

While not the most technologically advanced hull, it relies on a plethora of ballistic hardpoints to accomplish its mission, which is more often than not defending orbital installations and vital points of intra-system trade routes. A poor shield emitter which is difficult to manage and thus, rarely engaged, gives way to an almost impregnable interlocking armor belt system making the Dominator safe from most weapons. Even strike craft cannot overcome the hail of projectiles that can be launched to intercept their payloads. This hull proves that tried and true military engineering is difficult to overcome by new ideas and technologies, especially when in the hands of tough, determined crews and experienced officers.

Dependable, durable, and a constant presence in home space around civilized worlds and outposts, the Dominator is perhaps most hated and feared by pirates and law-breaking corporate agents. ",,,

Eagle-class cruisers are often found at the core of military fleets headed for battle. It is not hard to see why: A strong overall profile, with a robust engine, the Eagle's deadly weapons package is a threat to all enemies.

The Eagle can deliver a strong tactical punch to enemy formations. Its numerous turret and hardpoint emplacements make it very dangerous to smaller foes. Decent armor and a strong shield emitter let it hold space while outnumbered, or even when faced with the rare larger ship. 

These strengths are somewhat countered by strike craft - an Eagle captain must always watch their scopes for an approaching strike squadron, since their ship will be easily crippled by multiple hits from modern strike weapons. 

The embodiment of the sleek and powerful space cruiser from the time of the Domain, the Eagle-class ships are a beautiful reminder of the technological and aesthetic achievements of humanity's past. ","Agile for a cruiser, the Eagle is difficult to flank and has impressive and focused frontal firepower.",,

The Champion-class heavy cruiser is a versatile warship featuring a range of powerful energy weapons; the crowning element is a heavy energy turret mounting, rare among midline ships. This offensive array is backed by a robust energy grid capable of supercharging the energy weapon loadout, increasing damage output to devastating levels. A heavy missile hardpoint complements the loadout by enabling the Champion to unleash a crippling strike without taxing flux levels. The Champion is a solid and capable contender, able to face capital ships on the battle-line.

A relatively recent design, the Champion is a product of the historically recent ""Cruiser School"" naval revolution that never saw active service in the pre-collapse Domain Armada. Although prototypes were constructed and forge-ready specifications distributed to several battlegroups, the Champion was never cleared for active deployment due to an ongoing lawsuit between Altair Exotech and Orion Shipyards. Each megacorp accused the other of industrial espionage and innappropriately influencing the Armada officers overseeing the procurement process. The truth was more complex, inflaming longstanding rivalries in the officer corps as the investigatory committee called witness after witness. The Collapse prevented any sort of conclusive ruling from reaching the Persean Sector however, and now the entire matter is considered irrelevant. With the discovery of Champion plans on a Domain armaments courier, the warship was quickly put into service by the fleet of the Persean League, among others.",,,,

The Odyssey was considered a boondoggle of a design by the Domain Naval Procurement Committee with numerous objections raised: no single tactical focus, the officer boardrooms are too large, the energy grid uses only premium components, and the fittings are too expensive. Despite several rounds of eye-watering budget overruns and rumblings of a bribery scandal, the production contract was only denied before final prototype trials. Never keen to pass up a profitable opportunity, Altair Exotech licensed the Odyssey class to several frontier development corporations, including Eridani-Utopia, to provide admirably armed mobile survey headquarters and operation platforms. It is for this role in the megacorporate exploitation of the frontiers that the otherwise rare Odyssey-class found its way to the Persean Sector.",,,,
