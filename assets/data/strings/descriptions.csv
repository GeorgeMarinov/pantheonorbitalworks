torgue_basic_brawler,SHIP,"This ship has been refitted by the Torgue smiths and features heavier armor plating, increased overall performance and unique systems.
This ship has been refitted by the Torgue smiths and features heavier armor plating, increased overall performance and unique systems. Typically deployed to beef up system police forces and port authority security, the Brawler-class frigate is a robust design which trades mobility (and comfort) for impressive firepower, armor, and a destroyer-grade power generator.",,,

torgue_basic_phase_afflictor,SHIP,This ship has been refitted by the Torgue smiths and features heavier armor plating, increased overall performance and unique systems.A dangerous and swift phase frigate with a weapons loadout that is powerful enough to bring down much heavier ships. The Afflictor possesses a device which exploits a unique modification of its integrated phase coil array to project a field of anomalously amplified entropy. This effects a devastating increase in destructive instability in delicate or finely tuned systems when the targeted vessel experiences chaotic high-energy events ie. combat damage. Everything that can possibly go wrong does.,,,

torgue_basic_monitor,SHIP,"This ship has been refitted by the Torgue smiths and features heavier armor plating, increased overall performance and unique systems.

An oddity among ships, the Monitor is the result of the line of thought that “sometimes the best defense is indeed the best defense”. Features turret mounts angled to provide wide arcs and a unique “flux shunt” modification to its power systems specially constructed to relieve flux generated by shields. Indeed, the Monitor makes up for a lack of maneuverability and firepower with the ability to withstand prolonged bombardment from enemy ordnance.

Though its experimental nature is perhaps a sign of the innovation that eras of turmoil seem to inspire, whether the Monitor’s radical defensive focus is a boon or pitfall remains contentious. Several dramatic failures in convoy protection patrols were explained by Ko Combine PR representatives to be the fault of improper tactics employed by convoy commanders. Ko Combine maintains that when positioned correctly in a combat situation and supported by strike-craft - as the anvil and hammer, respectively - simulations demonstrate that the Monitor significantly enhances convoy survivability against the average pirate attack. Prominent critics remain.",,,

torgue_basic_cerberus,SHIP,"This ship has been refitted by the Torgue smiths and features heavier armor plating, increased overall performance and unique systems.

The Cerberus is prized for providing a cost-effective balance between cargo capacity and enough combat power for its size to discourage casual piracy with the happy result of lowered insurance rates compared to standard Domain-era civilian grade freighters. The Cerberus is now widely considered to be a wise platform of operation for independent traders in the Sector. 

In times past, before the fall of the gate system when Domain authority reigned, combat-enabled freighters like the Cerberus found only niche use on the edges of the rare warzone or in especially uncivilized hinterlands of the galaxy where Domain Armada patrols were stretched thinly. The crew combat training, weapon maintenance, and mass/thrust ratio loss caused by heavier armour were viewed as causing unnecessary cost overhead. But this is a new age filled with both danger and profitable opportunities; the abilities of the Cerberus have given the hull a new life in the trade lanes.",,,

pow_patheon_planet,CUSTOM,"A rich and majestic terrestrial planet Pantheon is home to the Vulcans, strong and kind humans with creative minds. Up to this day Vulcans live in harmony with themselfs and Pantheon preserving the planet's ecosystem and building marvellous structures. Atop the skies a giant metal god forges masterpice after masterpiece.

The god, known as Pantheon Orbital Works can be described as a colossal shipyard with a singular purpose: crafting legendary space vessels. Skilled vulcan smiths and relentless automatons are the blood that flows through this god's veins powering state of the art dockyards.

Pantheon Orbital Works does not turn down contracts. While its prices are high the station produces ships of both quality and quantity for the Sector. The most distinct feature are the three docks Jupiter, Juno and Neptune capable of building titan class ships, while currently silent it is rumored that each dock has produced exactly a single titan class...",,,
