torgue_basic_brawler,SHIP,"This ship has been refitted by the Torgue smiths and features heavier armor plating, increased overall performance and unique systems.
This ship has been refitted by the Torgue smiths and features heavier armor plating, increased overall performance and unique systems. Typically deployed to beef up system police forces and port authority security, the Brawler-class frigate is a robust design which trades mobility (and comfort) for impressive firepower, armor, and a destroyer-grade power generator.",,,

torgue_basic_phase_afflictor,SHIP,This ship has been refitted by the Torgue smiths and features heavier armor plating, increased overall performance and unique systems.A dangerous and swift phase frigate with a weapons loadout that is powerful enough to bring down much heavier ships. The Afflictor possesses a device which exploits a unique modification of its integrated phase coil array to project a field of anomalously amplified entropy. This effects a devastating increase in destructive instability in delicate or finely tuned systems when the targeted vessel experiences chaotic high-energy events ie. combat damage. Everything that can possibly go wrong does.,,,

pow_patheon_planet,CUSTOM,"A rich and majestic terrestrial planet Pantheon is home to the Vulcans, strong and kind humans with creative minds. Up to this day Vulcans live in harmony with themselfs and Pantheon preserving the planet's ecosystem and building marvellous structures. Atop the skies a giant metal god forges masterpice after masterpiece.

The god, known as Pantheon Orbital Works can be described as a colossal shipyard with a singular purpose: crafting legendary space vessels. Skilled vulcan smiths and relentless automatons are the blood that flows through this god's veins powering state of the art dockyards.

Pantheon Orbital Works does not turn down contracts. While its prices are high the station produces ships of both quality and quantity for the Sector. The most distinct feature are the three docks Jupiter, Juno and Neptune capable of building titan class ships, while currently silent it is rumored that each dock has produced exactly a single titan class...",,,
