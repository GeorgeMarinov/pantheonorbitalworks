This ship has been refitted by the Torgue smiths and features heavier armor plating, increased overall performance and unique systems. Typically deployed to beef up system police forces and port authority security, the Brawler-class frigate is a robust design which trades mobility (and comfort) for impressive firepower, armor, and a destroyer-grade power generator.",,,

torgue_basic_monitor,SHIP,"This ship has been refitted by the Torgue smiths and features heavier armor plating, increased overall performance and unique systems.

An oddity among ships, the Monitor is the result of the line of thought that “sometimes the best defense is indeed the best defense”. Features turret mounts angled to provide wide arcs and a unique “flux shunt” modification to its power systems specially constructed to relieve flux generated by shields. Indeed, the Monitor makes up for a lack of maneuverability and firepower with the ability to withstand prolonged bombardment from enemy ordnance.

Though its experimental nature is perhaps a sign of the innovation that eras of turmoil seem to inspire, whether the Monitor’s radical defensive focus is a boon or pitfall remains contentious. Several dramatic failures in convoy protection patrols were explained by Ko Combine PR representatives to be the fault of improper tactics employed by convoy commanders. Ko Combine maintains that when positioned correctly in a combat situation and supported by strike-craft - as the anvil and hammer, respectively - simulations demonstrate that the Monitor significantly enhances convoy survivability against the average pirate attack. Prominent critics remain.",,,

torgue_basic_cerberus,SHIP,"This ship has been refitted by the Torgue smiths and features heavier armor plating, increased overall performance and unique systems.

The Cerberus is prized for providing a cost-effective balance between cargo capacity and enough combat power for its size to discourage casual piracy with the happy result of lowered insurance rates compared to standard Domain-era civilian grade freighters. The Cerberus is now widely considered to be a wise platform of operation for independent traders in the Sector. 

In times past, before the fall of the gate system when Domain authority reigned, combat-enabled freighters like the Cerberus found only niche use on the edges of the rare warzone or in especially uncivilized hinterlands of the galaxy where Domain Armada patrols were stretched thinly. The crew combat training, weapon maintenance, and mass/thrust ratio loss caused by heavier armour were viewed as causing unnecessary cost overhead. But this is a new age filled with both danger and profitable opportunities; the abilities of the Cerberus have given the hull a new life in the trade lanes.",,,

torgue_basic_enforcer,SHIP,"This ship has been refitted by the Torgue smiths and features heavier armor plating, increased overall performance and unique systems.

The Enforcer-class ships commonly serve in system or convoy defense roles. The design features good armor and multiple ballistic hardpoints, while shield performance is somewhat underwhelming. 

The blueprints of the ship call for many components similar to those found in the Onslaught-class battleships, suggesting that the designs were created during a similar period of military expansion in the Domain. The Enforcer-class features similar no-nonsense weapon system design choices, tough bulkheads, and is well regarded by its crews.

Tough to beat in a destroyer to destroyer fight, the Enforcer rarely takes part in larger battles due to the common view that its low speed makes it a liability. Nonetheless, Hegemony order of battle doctrines mandate an attached Enforcer squadron as a screen for Onslaught-class battleships. The logistical ease with which shared components can be used by both ship types is exactly the type of detail that excites Hegemony Logisticarum bureaucrats.",,,

torgue_basic_shrike,SHIP,"This ship has been refitted by the Torgue smiths and features heavier armor plating, increased overall performance and unique systems.

An advanced fast-attack light destroyer from the same design team as the near-ubiquitous Wolf, the Shrike's advanced propulsion system is designed to selectively vent plasma in a 'microburn' maneuver. This allows the Shrike to dart into tactical opportunities as they arise, strike, and escape before a proper counter-attack is mounted. Shields, armour, and sustained flux capacity are somewhat underwhelming due to the need to build a light yet economical hull which prioritizes attack speed, leading to the Shrike gaining the reputation as a glass cannon best entrusted to skilled captains.

Certain unique structural elements in the plasma venting system are known to, with wear, corrode in oxygen-rich atmospheres, so care must be taken to re-apply ceramopolymer coating at each hull servicing.",,,

Up to this day Vulcans live in harmony with themselfs and Pantheon preserving the planet's ecosystem and building marvellous structures. Atop the skies a giant metal god forges masterpice after masterpiece.

The god, known as Pantheon Orbital Works can be described as a colossal shipyard with a singular purpose: crafting legendary space vessels. Skilled vulcan smiths and relentless automatons are the blood that flows through this god's veins powering state of the art dockyards.

Pantheon Orbital Works does not turn down contracts. While its prices are high the station produces ships of both quality and quantity for the Sector. The most distinct feature are the three docks Jupiter, Juno and Neptune capable of building titan class ships, while currently silent it is rumored that each dock has produced exactly a single titan class...",,,
